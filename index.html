								<p> You may have heard the phrase “We are all stardust.” This is absolutely true! Most elements, including oxygen, 
							            are created in stars and redistributed when the more massive stars die. Hydrogen is one of the few elements that 
							            was created at the beginning of the universe. Galaxies can have 100s of billions of stars, and those galaxies that 
								    are currently creating lots of stars are called star-forming galaxies (SFGs). The more stars in a galaxy that are 
							            created and die, the more oxygen that is created and redistributed within that galaxy. The relative amount of oxygen 
								    to hydrogen (metallicity) in a galaxy is an indicator of its chemical evolution. When we study chemical evolution, 
								    we study how the elements that make-up ‘us’ and all living things came to be. </p>
								<p>We can explore how galaxies evolve chemically when we measure their star-formation rates (SFRs) and their metallicity. 
									Both properties have many factors that can impact them, including how many galaxies are found around it (called 
									local galactic environment). The goal of my thesis is to determine how the local galactic environment of a galaxy 
									impacts its SFR and metallicity and if the impact changes over cosmic time. Unlike other sciences, we cannot bring 
									a galaxy into a lab to study it. We use the light we receive from the galaxies to make our measurements. We also
									don’t have billions of years to watch a galaxy evolve as it forms stars. Instead, we look back in time to see the 
									different stages of evolution in different galaxies. Because the speed of light is finite, it can take billions of 
									years for the light that leaves a distant galaxy to reach us. The more distant a galaxy, the farther back in time 
									we are exploring. </p>
								<p> Star Formation Across Cosmic Time (SFACT) is an innovative survey that can measure SFGs out to a look-back time of 7.7 
									billion years, and over a wide area on the sky. Therefore, SFACT creates a unique deep and wide survey to explore 
									the chemical evolution of SFGs. My thesis is to measure their SFRs and metallicities and relate these quantities to 
									their local galactic environment in order to probe their chemical evolution over a large range of look-back times. </p>
								<p> I am nearing completion on this project. Once I have a complete sample of galaxies obtained through observations, I will
									be able to do the analysis. I will then be able to understand a key part of galaxy evolution; we will be able to 
									answer how the galaxian SFR and the metallicity depend on the environment in which the galaxy resides, and whether 
									this changes over time. </p>

								<h2 class="major"> Outreach </h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> I love getting to take the time to share the the amazing wonders of the universe with diverse audiences. Through my association 
								    with the Department of Astronomy at Indiana University, I have been fortunate enough to organize and/or participate in over 70
								    outreach events! </p>
								<p> I was the graduate student Outreach Coordinator in the Department of Astronomy at Indiana University for two years (2021-2023). 
								    One of the activities I am most proud of include helping to organize the university-wide Science Fest of 2021 and 2022, where 
								    the university had a record number of visitors and we had to protect out attendees, who at the time, could not be vaccinated 
									against COVID-19. Another activity I am proud of is the Department's first attendance at a STEM festival at the world's largest
								    children's museum, the Children's Museum of Indianapolis. </p>
